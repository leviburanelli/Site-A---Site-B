The scenario is: I have 2 websites, Site A and Site B, both made in Drupal 7, and I need to find a way to display the content from Site A and the same content has to appear in Site B.

This project idea is to build a XML file that it's placed in the public folder of Site A, so other websites can load them.

To test it you will need a standart Drupal installation. Then you can download and enable the 'siteamod' and 'sitebmod'.

I'm using the content type 'Article' that comes with the standart Drupal installation.  
I also added 2 nodes for it, 'Article 1' and 'Article 2', both with Title, Body and image fields filled.

The 'siteamod' custom module was made to export the content. You have to determinate the type of content you want to export. Here, it uses the 'article' type for it and the filename is 'articles.xml'. The XML file, that has the RSS structure, is placed in the public folder, so other websites can get it and load it.

The 'sitebmod' custom module loads the xml file generated by the 'siteamod' and renders it inside of a block. The module also creates the block, so you just need to set the region you want to display it. If you look the 'siteamod.module', you will see it also has some options to sort the content and limit the number of content you want to display. 
If you want you can change the URL where the xml comes from, so you can use the 'sitebmod' in another website.

About display content in Site A: If you want to display the content in Site A, you can use the Views module, it's one of the most used Drupal modules made to display contents, users and taxonomies. Once you have it installed the Views module in your project you can use the script in the root of this project with the name 'views-articles-block.txt' to import a block that displays articles. However you can use the 'siteamod' for it, you just need to set the URL to the XML file.
